## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [Thomas Sankara's Solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFyMWwOxHYM) - This helped me fix the title in the container. I was really stuck on getting it to match the design and never thought to use headings. Also explained flex properties very well which I already knew but his explanation is what I will use in the future.
